<p>
    Persistence Explorer plugin for NetBeans is a convenient tool that mimics
    the Databases modules in NetBeans, providing support to JPA 2.0 with
    the following features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Manage the registry of persistence providers and persistence units 
        in the Services explorer view of NetBeans.
    </li>
    <li>
        Browse the metamodel of a registered persistence unit.
    </li>
    <li>
        Execute queries from within a simple JPQL editor against a registered
        persistence unit, and view the results.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    By now, it's just a <font color="red"><b>experimental</b></font> version
    with many limitations and known-issues, but it's still ideal for beginners
    of JPA 2.0 (like me:) to learn the API, run JPQL queries and then examine
    the results without the need to deploy your applications. Sorry for the
    temporary inconveniece, I'm working hard to improve its stability and
    usability, preparing for the first stable release.
</p>
<p>
    I'm totally a newbie to NetBeans module development. If you like the idea,
    please rate it. Thanks!  That will be really helpful to encourage me to
    continue the work.
</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
    The module adds a node named "Persistence" to the Services explorer view
    of the NetBeans. There are two child nodes, named "Persistence Providers"
    and "Persistence Units". The persistence providers node is a registry that
    allows user to register JPA 2.0 persistence provider implementations, and
    the persistence units node allows to register user persistence unit
    configuration files. Besides, the module depends on the Databases module's
    JDBC driver registry to "open" the registered user persistence units.
</p>
<p>
    To work with the module, following below steps:
</p>
<h4>Prepare Your Persistence Unit</h4>
<p>
    This module works ONLY with persistence unit configuration with the
    <b>RESOURCE_LOCALE</b> tranaction type. Package your entity classes
    and other required classes into jars together with a persistence.xml
    configuration file. Make sure they meet JPA 2.0 requirement for Java SE
    environment. For your convenience, here's an example of persistence.xml.
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;persistence-unit name="HrEclipselinkResourceLocalPu" transaction-type="RESOURCE_LOCAL"&gt;
    &lt;provider&gt;org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider&lt;/provider&gt;
    &lt;class&gt;org.javaplus.example.hr.Department&lt;/class&gt;
    &lt;class&gt;org.javaplus.example.hr.Employee&lt;/class&gt;
    &lt;class&gt;org.javaplus.example.hr.Project&lt;/class&gt;
    &lt;properties&gt;
      &lt;property name="eclipselink.logging.level" value="FINE"/&gt;
      &lt;property name="eclipselink.ddl-generation" value="create-tables"/&gt;
      &lt;property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.url" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hr"/&gt;
      &lt;property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.password" value="hradm"/&gt;
      &lt;property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.driver" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/&gt;
      &lt;property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.user" value="hradm"/&gt;
    &lt;/properties&gt;
  &lt;/persistence-unit&gt;
</pre>
<h4>Register Your Persistence Unit</h4>
<p>
    Once packaging is done, register your persistence unit to the explorer,
    by right-click the "Persistence Units", choose "New Persistence Unit",
    and fill up the form. Add all jars of your persistence unit to the list.
    The configuration files in all jars will be resolved automatically.
    Choose the configuration file and the unit name. Fill up other optional
    fields if needed. Make sure all files needed by your unit are registered,
    and the unit is valid.
</p>
<h4>Register Persistence Provider</h4>
<p>
    The persistence provider implementaion must be registered in the explorer
    in order to open and work with your persistence units.
</p>
<p>
    Open the provider registration form by right-click the persistence
    providers node, choose "New Peristence Provider", fill up the form by
    adding all required jars and naming the provider with a simple short name.
    Check your provider's documentation, make sure all needed jars are added.
</p>
<h4>Register JDBC Driver if Needed</h4>
<p>
    Make sure the JDBC driver needed by your unit is registered in the
    Databases explorer of the NetBeans. The persistence explorer will try to
    find required JDBC driver from there.
</p>
<h4>Work with Your Persistence Unit</h4>
<p>
    Before working with your persistence units, examine carefully the above
    steps you have done, make sure everything is ready. The module <b>DOES
    NO</b> validation at all by now, if anything goes wrong, it will just
    simply throw an ugly exception. You can figure out the problem by examining
    the stack trace. From the lower right corner of your IDE, you can find
    the exception indicator. Sorry for the inconvenience, I will improve this
    in the coming stable release.
</p>
<p>
    Now you can open your persistence unit by right-click on it, choose "Open",
    if everything is ok, congratulations, you can browse the metamodel of your
    unit. Currently, the browsing of the metamodel is just experimental.
</p>
<p>
    You can execute simple JPQL queries by choosing "Execute Command" from
    the persistence unit's context menu. That will take you to a simple plain
    JPQL editor. Tune your query, click "Execute Query", the result will
    show in the lower table view.
